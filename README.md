# Computer Vision for Real-Time Object Recognition

## 🎯 Project Goal
Computer Vision is transforming lives by enhancing the ability of machines to interpret visual data, leading to advancements in various fields, including self-driving vehicles. This project aims to compare the performance of several commonly used models in object recognition, focusing on the classification of images into three categories: cars, boats, and neither.

## 🌟 Features
- 📊 **Performance Comparison:** Evaluate different models to determine the most accurate in recognizing cars, boats, and neither.
- 📈 **Accuracy Improvement:** Train and fine-tune models to enhance the overall accuracy of object classification.
- 🔍 **Hazard Detection:** Emphasize real-time hazard recognition to contribute to safer autonomous driving technology.

## 📊 Model Training and Evaluation
- Utilize popular models like ResNet50 and InceptionV3.
- Train models using data generators and early stopping.
- Evaluate models based on precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC.
